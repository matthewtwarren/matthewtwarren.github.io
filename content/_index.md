### Hi, I’m Matt 👋

I'm a data scientist working in drug discovery at [The Institute of Cancer Research](https://www.icr.ac.uk), London, UK.

My research brings together data-driven modelling, cheminformatics, and machine learning to accelerate the discovery of novel oncology drugs that work through targeted protein degradation.

I obtained my PhD in Interdisciplinary Biomedical Research from University of Warwick, followed by Postdoctoral research at University of Oxford, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim.

Alongside my [research](/research), I enjoy playing and mixing music, running and cycling on trails, and getting creative with new tech – check out my [projects](/projects) to see some examples of what I’ve been working on.
