Welcome to my website -- thanks for stopping by! :waving_hand:
{{< /lead >}}

My name is Matt and I'm a (Postdoctoral) Computational Researcher in the Department of Biochemistry at the [University of Oxford](www.ox.ac.uk). In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, I work on developing data-driven models that predict protein-ligand binding affinities to accelerate drug discovery.  

Alongisde my work, I enjoy playing and mixing music, running and cycling on trails, and using technology to solve problems that make life easier and more enjoyable - check out my [projects](/projects) to see some examples of stuff I've been working on.
