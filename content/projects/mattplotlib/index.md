## Matt's Data Visualisation Library (`mattplotlib`)

At work, I can spend many hours a week generating plots and charts to communicate data, convey insights, and present ideas.

As a visual thinker, I'm also guilty of spending a bit too much time tweaking these plots, trying to ensure engaging and consistent styling, with colour schemes that are accessible, explanatory, and visually appealing.

`mattplotlib` is my attempt to streamline this process - a package of Python plotting helpers layered on Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, including a reusable Matplotlib style sheet and style configurations, giving all generated figures a customised and consistent look across backends.

I've also included a few of my favourite plots, wrapped up in easy-to-use functions, that elevate standard chart types and provide alternatives to the usual bar/line/pie charts, like the nested donut chart below. I'll be adding more styles over time.

For more details and to try it out youreself, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/matthewtwarren/mattplotlib), which includes a demo notebook with examples.
