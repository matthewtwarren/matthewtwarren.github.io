## Matt's Data Visualisation Library (`mattplotlib`)

At work, I can spend many hours a week generating plots and charts to communicate data, convey insights, findings, and present ideas.

As a visually-oriented person, I'm also guilty spending too much time tweaking these plots to ensure a clear, engaging and consistent style, with colour scheme that is accessible and visually appealing.

To help streamline this process, I created `mattplotlib` - a set of Python plotting helpers layered on Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. This includes a reusable Matplotlib style sheet and shared colour/font settings to give figures a customised and consistent look across backends.

I've also included a few of my favourite plots, wrapped up in easy-to-use functions, that elevate standard chart types and provide alternatives to the usual bar/line/pie charts. My latest favourite is the nested donut chart (below) – I'll be adding more styles over time.

For more details, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/matthewtwarren/mattplotlib), which includes a demo notebook with examples.
